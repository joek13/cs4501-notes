<ul>
<li>Convolution (most important)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sobel operator</li>
<li>Filtering in frequency</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sobel-operator">Sobel operator</h2>
<ul>
<li>One sobel kernel detects vertical edges, another detects horizontal</li>
<li>We take the absolute value of the output of each &ldquo;dot product&rdquo; because negative values don&rsquo;t make sense</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sobel-operators-and-calculus">Sobel operators and calculus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sobel operators are equivalent to 2d partial derivatives of the image</li>
<li>Vertical sobel operator - partial derivative with respect to X
<ul>
<li>A vertical edge is just a change in the image with respect to X</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Horizontal sobel operator - partial derivative with respect to Y</li>
<li>We can compute magnitude and phase at each location</li>
<li>Useful for detecting edges</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the image changing in x and y?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In image processing, convention is to describe your input image as \(f[x,y]\) (square brackets for discrete inputs)</p>
<h3 id="dealing-with-discreteness">Dealing with discreteness</h3>
<p>Digital images are not continuous, so we can&rsquo;t really take a derivative. But we can:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta_x f[x,y] = f[x+1,y] - f[x,y]
$$</p>
<p>Also:
$$
\Delta_x f[x,y] = f[x+1,y] - f[x-1,y]
$$</p>
<p>We can convert these definitions to convolutions.</p>
<p>i.e., second definition becomes:
$$
k(x,y) = [-1, 0, 1]
$$</p>
<h3 id="sobel-operators">Sobel operators</h3>
<p>Vertical sobel operators smooth in Y and then differentiate in X.</p>
<p>The Sobel kernel is the column matrix \([1,2,1] \times \) the row matrix \([1,0,-1]\)</p>
<h3 id="relationship-to-gradient">Relationship to gradient</h3>
<p>The vertical and horizontal sobel operators, taken together, represent the gradient of an iamge.</p>
<h2 id="frequency">Frequency</h2>
<ul>
<li>A brief trip to the analog, continuous world</li>
</ul>
<p>Some waves can be represented as the sum of other waves.
We can transmit signals by passing around &ldquo;numbers in the time dimension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Call some waveform \(f(x)\), such that \(f(x) = g(x) + h(x)\) where \(g, h\) are both sine waves</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> represent a signal in terms of its amplitude over time, but we can also represent it as intensity over different frequencies</p>
<h3 id="any-function-can-be-approximated-by-polynomials">Any function can be approximated by polynomials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taylor series expansion: any function can be represented as a summation of polynomials</li>
<li>&hellip;if you let your final polynomial have a very high degree</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is hard in practice. Periodic functions need to be approximated by many, many, many, many polynomials. The approximation won&rsquo;t last forever for a finite number of terms.</p>
<h2 id="jean-baptiste-joseph-fourier">Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier</h2>
<p>Crazy idea (1807): any function can be represented as the sum of sines and cosines.</p>
<p>Fourier transform takes a function in the time domain and transforms it to the frequency domain</p>
<ul>
<li>Fourier transform stores the magnitude and phase at each frequency</li>
<li>Magnitude encodes how much signal there is at a particular frequency</li>
<li>Phaes encodes spatial information indirectly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="issue-dft-is-slow">Issue: DFT is slow</h2>
<p>Solution: FFT</p>
<ul>
<li>a much more efficient approximation of the DFT, so efficient that it is often implemented in hardware</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="convolution-theorem">Convolution theorem</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
