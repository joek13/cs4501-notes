        <h1>00. Syllabus Day</h1><time>February 1, 2021</time></header><p>Slides are hosted on <a href="https://uva-cs.github.io/cs4102-s21/readme.html">the course website</a>.</p>
<p>Office hours are hosted on the class Discord.</p>
<h2 id="the-textbook">The textbook</h2>
<p>We &ldquo;really need&rdquo; to read and study material from the textbook.
Readings are posted as assigned, and the textbook can be accessed for free from the UVa Library.</p>
<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
<p>The course is divided into four modules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Divide and conquer / sorting</li>
<li>Graphs, MST, find-union</li>
<li>Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming</li>
<li>Network flow and reductions</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h2>
<p>Short assessments for each of the four modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will be take-home over a ~24 hour period</li>
</ul>
<p>Three possible grade outcomes: incomplete, satisfactory, mastered. You&rsquo;ll have three opportunities at most of these.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h2>
<p>Two kinds: most homeworks are programming assignments or written descriptions of algorithms / proofs</p>
<h3 id="programming-hw">Programming HW</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be written in Java, C++, Python</li>
<li>Almost HackerRank style problems</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="written-hw">Written HW</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solving small problems, analyzing runtimes, etc.</li>
<li>Proofs of correctness, etc.</li>
<li>Typeset in LaTeX</li>
</ul>
<p>Homeworks are also graded according to completeness. Homeworks can be submitted multiple times.</p>
<p>Homeworks have two deadlines: soft and hard. Soft deadlines are scheduled several days before quizzes, so you&rsquo;re best prepared. But the hard deadline is almost two weeks later. There is no grade penalty for missing the soft deadline.</p>
<h3 id="programming-homework">Programming homework</h3>
<p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the problem; hidden test cases are used for grading</li>
<li>Consider all boundary cases</li>
<li>Use pre-existing library code</li>
<li>Know how to handle floating point numbers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="typesetting">Typesetting</h3>
<p>Templates and tutorials are provided. Including images of text or formulas is verboten!</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>Quizzes are strictly independent.</p>
<p>Programming homeworks can be completed in groups of 3 or fewer to discuss the algorithmic aspects only.
(Credit your co-conspirators using a comment in your code.)</p>
<p>Written homeworks can be completed in groups of 3 or fewer, but you have to type up your own solution.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h2>
<p>Collaboration is allowed and encouraged.</p>
<p>Do not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share written solutions</li>
<li>Share documents (e.g., with Overleaf)</li>
<li>Share debugging of code</li>
<li>Seek published solutions online</li>
</ul>
<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to explain anything you submit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-you-already-know-from-cs2150">What you already know from CS2150</h3>
<ul>
<li>Definition of an algorithm</li>
<li>Definition of algorithm complexity</li>
<li>Measuring worst-case complexity</li>
<li>Cost as a function of input size</li>
<li>Asymptotic growth rate: \( O \), \( \Theta \)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-you-already-know-from-21023102">What you already know from 2102/3102</h3>
<ul>
<li>Proof by induction, contradiction</li>
<li>Counting, probability, combinatorics, permutations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-an-algorithm">Introducing an algorithm</h2>
<h3 id="a-first-algorithm-making-change">A first algorithm: making change</h3>
<p>Problem: given item cost, and amount paid, make change <em>(using the fewest possible coins)</em>.</p>
<p>E.g.: Costs $4.37, paid $5 â†’ two quarters, a dime, and three pennies</p>
<p>Solution: look at outstanding amount; while it&rsquo;s greater than zero, take the largest coin value that&rsquo;s less than the amount oustanding, add it to the change, and subtract its value.</p>
<p>Q: Is this solution optimal? How could we show this?
A: Prove that it&rsquo;s <em>impossible</em> to solve this more efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="greedy-algorithms">Greedy algorithms</h3>
<p>Example of a family called <em>greedy algorithms</em></p>
<p>Suitable for optimization problems: class of problems with many feasible solutions, but only one is optimal</p>
<p>Immediately greedy: at each step, choose the &ldquo;best&rdquo; solution for right now. Don&rsquo;t look into the future.</p>
<p>For some optimization problems, greedy algorithms are great; for others (e.g. select the best cheess move), they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Interesting note: our greedy algorithm is only best for American coins. For example: say we had an 11-cent coin (the Floryan), making change for 15 cents.</p>
<p>Our algorithm says: <code>1 Floryan, 4 pennies</code>. But a better solution exists: <code>1 dime, 1 nickel</code>.</p>
<p>Can we come up with a change algorithm that generalizes better? There are a few approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brute force</li>
<li>Dynamic programming</li>
</ul>
