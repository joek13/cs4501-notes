## What is computer vision?
We want to make computers understand images and video. Matters in safety, healthcare, security, comfort, fun, etc.

Main goals:
- Recognition (e.g., birdsnap, which identifies bird species pictorally)

Computer vision: image → knowledge (how can we extract information from an image)

Image processing: image → image (how can we process an image)

Computer graphics: knowledge → image
